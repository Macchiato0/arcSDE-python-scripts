This script is being developed for the purpose of updating the work headquarters field for the following feature classes:
                    1.	Dynamic Protective Device
                    2.	Fuse
                    3.	Miscellaneous Network Features (MNF) 
                    4.	PF Correcting Equipment (Capacitor in ArcMap TOC)
                    5.	Primary Overhead Conductor
                    6.	Primary Underground Conductor
                    7.	Secondary Overhead Conductor
                    8.	Secondary Underground Conductor
                    9.	Switch
                    10.	Transformer
                    11.	Voltage Regulator (Regulators and Boosters in ArcMap TOC)
                    
                    **** Maybe remove the "IS NULL" part of the SQL selection so every record for a feederID is updated properly ****
